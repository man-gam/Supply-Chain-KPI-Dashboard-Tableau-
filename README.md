# ðŸ“Š Supply Chain & Sales Performance Dashboard (Tableau)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  

### ðŸ”¹ Data Integration & Modeling  
- Connected multiple datasets (sales, products, factories, targets, postal codes).  
- Created relationships between fact and dimension tables.  
- Designed calculated fields for KPIs such as sales variance, distance to customer, and rank.  

### ðŸ”¹ Geospatial Analysis  
- Built a multi-layer map visualizing:  
  - Factory locations  
  - Customer locations  
  - Distance between customers and factories  
  - Dynamic buffer zones based on configurable shipping radius  
- Identified customers eligible for 2-day shipping.  

### ðŸ”¹ Customer & Performance Metrics  
- Ranked customers by 2024 sales volume and factory assignment.  
- Created a performance table showing rank, customer ID, factory, distance, orders, units, and sales.  
- Added KPI visual comparing 2024 sales vs. targets.  

### ðŸ”¹ Executive Dashboard  
- Consolidated all visuals into a single Tableau dashboard.  
- Included interactive parameters (e.g., shipping buffer radius).  
- Designed with an executive-friendly layout highlighting KPIs at a glance.

## âš¡ Challenges  
- Data integration complexity â€“ handling multiple datasets with different keys.  
- Geospatial accuracy â€“ ensuring distance calculations were correct and parameterized.  
- KPI alignment â€“ creating trusted variance between actual vs. target.  
- Performance design â€“ balancing detail with high-level KPIs in one dashboard.  

---

## ðŸ”Ž Key Insights  
- Factories vary in specialization vs. diversification of product lines.  
- Customers outside the buffer zone face higher delivery costs & longer lead times.  
- Sales targets were uneven across divisions, with clear over- and under-performers.  
- A small group of customers contributed most revenue (Pareto principle).  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Recommendations  
- Optimize factory-to-customer allocation â†’ reassign customers closer to alternative factories.  
- Expand buffer coverage â†’ consider new warehouses in underserved regions.  
- Focus on underperforming divisions â†’ analyze pricing, demand, and capacity issues.  
- Strengthen key customer relationships â†’ offer tailored agreements for top clients.
